#'edbuildmapr: A package to download school district geospatial data, perform spatial
#'analysis, and create formatted exportable maps.
#'
#'Import US Census Bureau, Education Demographic and Geographic Estimates
#'Program, Composite School District Boundaries Files for 2013-2017 with the
#'option to attach EdBuild's master dataset of school district finance, student
#'demographics, and community economic indicators for every school district in
#'the United States. The master dataset is built from the US Census, Annual
#'Survey of School System Finances (F33) and joins data from the National Center
#'for Education Statistics, Common Core of Data; the US Census, Small Area
#'Income and Poverty Estimates; and the US Census, Education Demographic and
#'Geographic Estimates. Additional functions in the package create a dataset of
#'all pairs of school district neighbors as either a dataframe or a shapefile
#'and create formatted maps of selected districts at the state or neighbor
#'level, symbolized by a selected variable in EdBuild's master dataset. For full
#'details about 'EdBuild' data processing please see: EdBuild (2019)
